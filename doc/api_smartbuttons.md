# Configure smartbuttons via the RESTful API

## Overview

As the name already says, some buttons in your **Wiser-by-Feller** environment are smart.
But don't worry, they are not smart at all, you still have to press the (smart-)button yourself.

A smartbutton can de married with a [job](./api_jobs.md).
That means, by pressing the smartbutton a configured [job](./api_jobs.md) will be executed.

**Do not forget to include the [authentication token](./authentication.md) in all your requests!**

> üêÆ I have not get married yet, probably a smart decision?

## Types of smartbuttons

They are two kind of smartbuttons:

- Smartbuttons from type: `scene`
  - Example button-frontset (2x scene)

    ![Scene-Button-2](./images/wiser_button_symbol_scene_2.png)

- Smartbuttons from type: `groupctrl`
  - Example button-frontset (1x plus/minus)

    ![Group-Control-Button-Plus-Minus](./images/wiser_button_symbol_groupcontrol_up_down.png)

## Configure smartbuttons

The configuration of a smartbutton consists of the following steps:

1) Activated the programming mode (*program*)
    - Choose between `scene` or `groupctrl` smartbuttons
    - Configure the blink-time. The default is 60 seconds
    - At this point the smartbuttons do not blinking yet

2) Run the notify (*notify*)
    - Now the available smartbuttons will start blinking
      - `scene`-smartbuttons (will blinking `purple`)
      - `groupctrl`-smartbuttons (will blinking `yellow`)
    - As soon as one of the blinking smartbutton is pressed, all smartbuttons stop blinking and the notify request comes back with a response

3) The Marriage
    - At this point you can configure a [job](./api_jobs.md). Now the marriage of the smartbutton within a [job](./api_jobs.md) can take place.
