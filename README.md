# Wiser-by-Feller RESTFul API Overview

> 🐮 Hi, my name is **Lapi**, I'm a happy swiss-cow! I am glad that you find the long way here! I will take you on my back and guide you through this wonderful documentation.

The Wiser-by-Feller RESTFul API enables you to manage all your **Wiser-by-Feller** system devices.

Per example, it's possible to turn on or off the lights in your house over the RESTFul API. You can get the state of the lights and do other crazy IoThings.

> 🐮 Wow sounds great, I would like to turn off the bell on my neck!
